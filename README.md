(Sprite sheet not included, since it is paid. asset are at https://itch.io/s/88220/the-dark-series-bundle)

Thank you Penusbmic

To run exe you will need young swordmen asset from Penusbemic and place it in resource/padawan
The spritesheet should be centered. Use ![sprite editor]: https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama
and under image there should be centerize image. 
The sprite sheet should the renamed to pad.png or you can change the animation config path.

This will be change later to use custom asset that are accessable in the repo which will not break the executable.
